View the live project [here](https://darraghreid.github.io/dara-MS1/)

This website was created for Code Institute's Milestone 1 Project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Web Development. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's knowledge and skills aquired thus far in the course. 
This includes skills in HTML, CSS, as well as other User Centric Design skills as outlined in the Technologies section.

This site was created for the musician, DaRa. It is designed for those who wish to listen to his music and contact him, if they wish. 
The site has been designed to be fully responsive across most devices and browsers.

## Structure 

The site is designed as a single webpage with multiple sections. 
Each section is linked to in the home page as well as in call-to-action buttons throughout the site.
This should result in fast and intuitive navigation.

The navigation bar is structured from left to right in order of importance,
though the "about" and "listen" sections are swapped when scrolling for visual reasons.

## Design

* Colour Scheme
    * The colours used in this project are rgb(124, 124, 124)/dark grey, rgb(238, 229, 233)/beige-pink, and rgb(243, 178, 114)/orange-yellow.
    The beige-pink and orange-yellow compliment the colour scheme of the content (images and videos) while the dark grey offers a good dark constrast to the other two.

* Typeography
    * The fonts used throughout the site are Roboto and Big Shoulders Inline Text
    Big Shoulders Inline Text is used for the logo as well as all H1 headings,
    while Roboto is used in all other instances.

* Imagery
    * All imagery was supplied by the artist. 
    The images used in the homepage carousel were carefully chosen to give users immediate confirmation as to the type of site they are visiting.
    As mentioned in the User Stories section, it is important for users to immediately understand the purpose of the site.

    The image used in the "About" section was carefully chosen to represent who DaRa is as an artist.
